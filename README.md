This is a Symfony project for event registrations, exposed as an API only with no dedicated UI.
Interactive documentation is available via NelmioApiDoc at the /api/doc
 route, configured with Swagger UI.
For authenticated endpoints using session cookies, Swagger UIâ€™s Try it out cannot perform requests due to browser restrictions, so HTTPie was used for testing instead.
To seed test data, a lightweight Foundry factory and seeder are included and can be executed with: php bin/console foundry:load-fixtures main
